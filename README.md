\#\# 🚀 Executive Summary  
Most drivers track "Gross Pay" but fail to account for "Total Lifecycle Costs," leading to financial failure. VextorGrid solves this by providing a \*\*"Single Source of Truth"\*\* for every mile driven and every cent spent.

\#\#\# The 3 Core Personas  
1\. \*\*The Professional Trucker:\*\* Needs \*\*Audit Defense\*\* and \*\*True CPM\*\* (Cost Per Mile) to prove business viability to banks/insurance.  
2\. \*\*The Gig Driver:\*\* Needs a \*\*Tax Shield\*\*. Tracks deductions (home office, data plans) to minimize 1099 liability.  
3\. \*\*The Personal Owner:\*\* Needs \*\*Resale Maximization\*\*. Creates a "Verified Digital Logbook" to prove aerospace-grade maintenance.

\#\# ⚠️ Workflow Rules ("Vibe Coding" SOP)  
To prevent file conflicts and credit-burn:  
1\. \*\*The "One Truck" Rule:\*\* Never run \`bolt.diy\` and \`Kilo Code\` at the same time. Reboot before switching.  
2\. \*\*Credit Defense:\*\* Use \`Bolt.new\` for UI prototyping only. Use \`Bolt.diy\` \+ DeepSeek for logic.  
3\. \*\*Forensics:\*\* Use Grok to audit the \`.zip\` or Repo before major version changes.

\> \*\*Note:\*\* For the complete technical specifications, database schema, and future roadmap, consult the \*\*\`PROJECT\_DOSSIER.md\`\*\* file in this repository.
